# GWigWam_AStar
A* test, a start, goal, walls and some yellow blocks.

Hobby project I created a few years back (+/- 2010), not under active development.

See [release.zip](release.zip) for a compiled version. To run:

 - Extract all the files in the .zip
 - Run the AStar.jar file
 - Holding `space` shows the algorithm in action
 - Pressing `R` adds random walls
